# GDocs Lite

This is an HTML/CSS/JS web app that uses Firebase to simulate Google docs.

Here's a hosted copy of the app: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54560358/gdocs-clone/index.html

The corresponding firebase is here: https://gdocslite.firebaseio.com.

The simplest way to run this app is by cloning the repo and just opening the index.html file in your browser.

The simplest way to host this app is probably by using the Dropbox Public Folder.
